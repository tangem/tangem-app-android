    \n
    \n2. Risks related to the use of Software
    \n
    \nTangem will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the scope of the following five categories:
    \n
    \na) Mistakes made by the user of any cryptocurrency-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong addresses, and accidental deletion of blockchain wallets on Cards.
    \n
    \nb) Problems of Software and/or any blockchain- or cryptocurrency- related software or service, e.g., corrupted files, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware.
    \n

    \n3. Trading and Investment risks
    \n
    \nThere is considerable exposure to risk in any crypto-currency or other digital asset exchange transaction. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in crypto-currency exchange speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.

    \n
    \nBefore you engage in transactions using an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and regulations of the exchanges offering the system and/or listing the instruments you intend to trade.

You should understand these and additional risks before trading.

    \n
    \n7. Limitation of liability

    \nUnless otherwise required by law, in no event shall the owners of, or contributors to, the Software be liable for any damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of data arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the Software.
