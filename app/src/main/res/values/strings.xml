    \n
    \na) Mistakes made by the user of any cryptocurrency-related software or service, e.g., forgotten passwords, payments sent to wrong addresses, and accidental deletion of blockchain wallets on Cards.

    \n3. Trading and Investment risks
    \n
    \nThere is considerable exposure to risk in any crypto-currency or other digital asset exchange transaction.

You should understand these and additional risks before trading.
