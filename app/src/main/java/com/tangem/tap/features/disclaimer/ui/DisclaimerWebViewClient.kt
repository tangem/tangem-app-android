             <h1>Legal Disclaimer</h1>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Tangem application (Software)</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Software is intended for usage only with Tangem hardware wallets (Cards) via NFC interface. The
                Software DOES NOT:</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Generate, store, transmit, or have access to private (secret) cryptographic keys to 
                blockchain
                wallets holding digital assets, including crypto-currency.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Generate, store, transmit, or have access to secret keys, passwords, passphrases, recovery phrases
                that can be used to restore or to copy private (secret) keys to blockchain wallets holding digital assets, including
                crypto-currency.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Provide exchange, trading, investment services on behalf of Tangem AG.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Risks related to the use of Software</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tangem will not be responsible for any losses, damages or claims arising from events falling within the
                scope of the following five categories:</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a) Mistakes made by the user of any cryptocurrency-related software or service, e.g., forgotten
                passwords, payments sent to wrong addresses, and accidental deletion of blockchain wallets on Cards.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b) Problems of Software and/or any blockchain- or cryptocurrency- related software or service, e.g.,
                corrupted files, incorrectly constructed transactions, unsafe cryptographic libraries, malware.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; c) Technical failures in the hardware of the user, including Cards, of any cryptocurrency-related
                software or service, e.g., data loss due to a faulty or damaged storage device.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; d) Security problems experienced by the user of any cryptocurrency-related software or 
                service, e.g.,
                unauthorized access to users&apos; wallets and/or accounts.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; e) Actions or inactions of third parties and/or events experienced by third parties, e.g., bankruptcy
                of service providers, information security attacks on service providers, and fraud conducted by third parties.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Trading and Investment risks</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is considerable exposure to risk in any crypto-currency or other digital asset exchange
                transaction. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for
                changing economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in
                crypto-currency exchange speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values
                fluctuate. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Electronic Trading Risks</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before you engage in transactions using an electronic system, you should carefully review the rules and
                regulations of the exchanges offering the system and/or listing the instruments you intend to trade. Online trading
                has inherent risk due to system response and access times that may vary due to market conditions, system
                performance, and other factors. You should understand these and additional risks before trading.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Compliance with tax obligations &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The users of the Software are solely responsible to determinate what, if any, taxes apply to their
                crypto-currency transactions. The owners of, or contributors to, the Software are NOT responsible for determining
                the taxes that apply to crypto-currency transactions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. No warranties &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Software is provided on an &quot;as is&quot; basis without any warranties of any kind regarding the
                Software and/or any content, data, materials and/or services provided on the Software. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                &nbsp;</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Limitation of liability</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless otherwise required by law, in no event shall the owners of, or contributors to, the Software be
                liable for any damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of data
                arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the Software. In no way are the owners of, or contributors
                to, the Software responsible for the actions, decisions, or other behavior taken or not taken by you in reliance
                upon the Software.</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Last amendment</p>
             <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This disclaimer was amended for the last time on October 1st, 2020.</p>
