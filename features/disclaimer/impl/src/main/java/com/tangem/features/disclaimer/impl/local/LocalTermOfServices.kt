  <p>7.2.	As a matter of principle, Cardholder is liable for any risks resulting from the misuse of Tangem Wallet (Card) and/or Official Mobile Application. In any case, Cardholder is solely liable for all transactions authorized using a means of access.</p>

  <p>7.13.	Cardholder agrees to indemnify and hold Tangem, its affiliates, and service providers harmless from any claims, losses, or damages incurred as a result of their actions on third-party platforms, as outlined in the Terms of Services.</p>
