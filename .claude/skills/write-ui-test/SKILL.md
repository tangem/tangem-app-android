description: Write a Kaspresso/Compose instrumentation UI test for the Tangem Android app following project conventions — test class shape, page-object locations, Allure step naming, WireMock scenario setup, synchronization, and meaningful assertions. Covers known Compose traps (PullToRefreshBox swipe, TangemHoldToConfirmButton, Decompose lifecycle, hot-wallet access code) and the build/run/debug flow. Use when the user asks to write, add, port, or fix an instrumentation / androidTest / UI test, a page object, or a test scenario ("напиши UI-тест", "добавь инструментальный тест", "напиши тест в androidTest", "page object", "автотест на экран").

Write an instrumentation (androidTest) UI test for the Tangem Android app. These conventions are
enforced by reviewers (tnagmetulla, dpodoynikov) — applying them up front skips a review round.

This is an **interactive** skill: if scope is ambiguous (which screen, which flow, what the final
assertion should verify), ask before writing. Do not invent UI text or test tags — read the real
production source and reuse existing patterns.

## When to use

Use for instrumented UI tests under `app/src/androidTest/` (Kaspresso + Kakao-Compose), page objects,
and test scenarios. **Not** for JVM/Robolectric unit tests (`testDebugUnitTest`) — those follow a
different setup.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify scope.** Which screen/flow, which Allure TC#, and what the *final assertion* verifies.
   Ask if any of these is unclear.
2. **Find an existing sibling test to mirror.** Grep `app/src/androidTest/` for a test on a similar
   screen (e.g. `SendViaSwapTest`). Match its structure rather than inventing one. Read the real
   production composable to get the actual `testTag`s and string resources — never guess UI text.
3. **Locate / extend page objects** in `com/tangem/screens/` (see Locations). Add new ones there,
   never inside the scenario or test file.
4. **Set up WireMock scenarios** in the *test body* if the flow depends on backend state
   (see `reference/running-and-debugging.md`).
5. **Write the test** per Conventions below.
6. **Build BOTH APKs, install, run, and classify the result** correctly — Allure post-run hook
   failures are not test failures (see `reference/running-and-debugging.md`).

## Porting a test from iOS

When the user asks to **port** an iOS test to Android:

- **Default to the sibling iOS repo `../tangem-app-ios/`** (next to `tangem-app-android`). If that path
  doesn't exist, **ask the user** where the iOS repo is — don't guess.
- iOS UI tests live under `TangemUITests/`; look there for the source test, its page objects
  (`*Screen`), and accessibility identifiers (`*AccessibilityIdentifiers`).
- Port the *intent and steps*, not the API. Map the iOS stack to the Android one:
  XCUITest/accessibility identifiers → Compose `testTag`; iOS `*Screen` page objects → Kotlin page
  objects in `com/tangem/screens/`; XCTest assertions → Kaspresso/Truth assertions. Re-derive the real
  Android `testTag`s and string resources from production source — never reuse iOS identifier strings.
- **Card/wallet mock mapping — where iOS uses `wallet2`, Android uses the default `Wallet`**
  (`openMainScreen()` with no `productType` → `ProductType.Wallet`). Do NOT port iOS `.wallet2` to
  `ProductType.Wallet2`. Other cards map directly: iOS `.twin` → `ProductType.Twins`, `.xrpNote` →
  `ProductType.Note`, `.four12` → `Firmware412MockContent` (via the `mockContent` param). `ProductType.Wallet2`
  exists but is a distinct Wallet-2.0-card case, not the iOS-`wallet2` analog.
- **A wallet has no balance until you sync.** The default `Wallet` mock starts with missing derivations
  ("Some addresses are missing"); the fiat balance shows `—` until you call `synchronizeAddresses()` after
  `openMainScreen()` (mirror `TotalBalanceUpdateTest`). Any test asserting a balance/fiat-equivalent must
  sync first, then `waitUntil` the value loads — balances re-load asynchronously (e.g. after an app-currency
  change the equivalent repaints with a delay).
- The WireMock scenarios are usually shared across platforms, but the branch may differ
  (see `reference/running-and-debugging.md`).

## Conventions (must-follow)

### Test class shape

- **Test method names are camelCase and always end with `Test`** (e.g. `groupTokensTest()`,
  `renameWalletTest()`). Never use `snake_case` and never the unit-test `GIVEN … WHEN … THEN …`
  backtick phrasing — that GWT convention is for JVM unit tests only, not instrumentation tests.
- **Scenario state setup goes in the test body**, not inside the open-the-feature helper. Each test
  starts with explicit `step("Set WireMock scenario '$name' to '$state'") { setWireMockScenarioState(name, state) }`
  calls, then calls a thin helper (e.g. `openTangemPay()`) that only opens the screen. Mirror the
  `SendViaSwapTest` pattern.
- **Open-the-feature helpers stay thin** — no scenarios-as-parameters, no scenario juggling inside.
- **Every scenario name + state is a `val`** at the top of the test method. Reviewers reject magic
  strings inside `step(...)`.
- **Each click is its own** `step("Click on '$x' button")`. Combining clicks into one step hides which
  click failed in the Allure report.
- **Every scenario call in the test body is wrapped in its own `step("…")`**, even though the scenario
  itself contains inner `step(...)`s — the outer step names the flow in the Allure tree, the inner ones
  detail it (nested steps are expected). `step(...)` (Allure) is callable anywhere, including inside
  scenario extension functions; only `flakySafely` is restricted to the `TestCase` body. Caveat: don't
  wrap a *mutating* scenario (e.g. one that long-clicks to sign+send) in `flakySafely` — a retry would
  re-fire the action; rely on the assertion's own built-in retry instead.
- **Step naming**: `Click on 'X' button` (not "Tap X"); `Assert <thing> is displayed` / `is not displayed`.
  Reviewers reject `is visible`, `does not exist`, `Check X visible` — the convention is **`is displayed` /
  `is not displayed`** even though older tests in the file may still use the old phrasing (don't copy it).
- **No conditional `if (foo.isDisplayedSafely()) foo.performClick()`** for elements that are
  deterministically present after `pm clear` — the `if` is dead code. Use a straight `performClick()`.

### Locations

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Page objects | `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/tangem/screens/…` — **always** |
| Common test helpers | `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/tangem/common/utils/` |
| Feature scenarios | `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/tangem/scenarios/` |
| Cross-feature helper (e.g. `confirmSwapByHolding`) | the **feature-of-origin** scenarios file (e.g. `SwapScenarios.kt`), not the consumer's |

Scenario files orchestrate flows; they must not define page objects or duplicate generic helpers.

### Strings

- **No hardcoded UI text** in matchers. Use `getResourceString(R.string.foo)` from
  `com.tangem.core.res.R` or `com.tangem.core.ui.R`. The Detekt rule `UnsafeStringResourceUsage`
  enforces this for production code; reviewers extend it to test code informally.

### Allure IDs

- **Every test method gets its own unique `@AllureId`.** Never reuse the same id across two test methods —
  not even for two variants of one manual case. If a manual case is split into multiple automated tests
  (e.g. a positive and a negative variant), each test must be linked to its own distinct Allure case/id.
  (Note: iOS sometimes shares one id across methods — do NOT mirror that here.)

### Assertions

- **Never** use Kotlin's built-in `assert(...)` — Android instrumentation runs don't enable JVM
  assertions, so `assert(false)` is a silent no-op. Use Truth / JUnit / Kaspresso / Kakao assertions.
- **Clipboard checks**: `assertClipboardTextEquals(expected, context)` from `common/utils/ClipboardUtils.kt`.
  Read displayed text via `KNode.extractText()` first if you need to compare against UI state.
- **Every test ends with a meaningful assertion**, not just an action. A test whose last step is
  "Click Submit" without verifying the result gets rejected.

### Waits and synchronization

- **Manual polls are banned** (`onAllNodes(matcher).fetchSemanticsNodes().isNotEmpty()` in a loop). Use:
  - `composeTestRule.waitUntilAtLeastOneExists(matcher, timeoutMillis)` — wait for one thing to appear.
  - `composeTestRule.waitUntil(timeout) { runCatching { someAssertion() }.isSuccess }` — wait until an
    action no longer throws.
  - `composeTestRule.waitUntil(timeout) { matcherA exists || matcherB exists }` — the either/or case.
- **`flakySafely(timeout)`** (Kaspresso) is reachable only from `TestCase` subclasses, NOT from
  extension functions on `BaseTestCase`. In extension code use the `waitUntil` variants above.

### Comment hygiene

This repo enforces "no comments unless WHY is non-obvious", in test code too. One line max, WHY-only —
encode a hidden constraint, not what the code does. Example that earns its keep:
`// Create+confirm screens share ACCESS_CODE_INPUT — gate on confirm-screen title.`
Delete anything explaining WHAT a step does.

## Reference docs

- **`reference/compose-traps.md`** — read when the screen uses `PullToRefreshBox`,
  `TangemHoldToConfirmButton`, a Decompose model that fetches in `init {}`, or a hot-wallet import with
  an access code. These have silent failure modes that look like passing tests.
- **`reference/running-and-debugging.md`** — read when building, installing, running tests (orchestrator
  vs. raw `am instrument`), running against a local WireMock, interpreting CLI/Allure output, using
  `@Ignore`, or driving WireMock scenarios.
